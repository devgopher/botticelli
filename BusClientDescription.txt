# Clients

Client is component, responsible for interaction between systems. You should use client in these cases:

- you've a remote application, which has an Agent in order to interact with some API/Database and etc...
- you need to balance the load in you bot
- you need to reduce load to your bot

In general, a typical client has several methods:
- SendAndGetResponse() - sends request and waits for a response from a remote system
- SendResponse() - sends response to a queue
