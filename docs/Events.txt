## Bot events

The basic bot has several basic events:
```
    /* Rises on start */
    public event StartedEventHandler Started;
    /* Rises on stop */
    public event StoppedEventHandler Stopped;
    /* Rises on message receive and contains a received message */
    public abstract event MsgReceivedEventHandler MessageReceived;
    /* Rises when message is removedm contains message id */
    public abstract event MsgRemovedEventHandler MessageRemoved;
    /* Platform-specific event */
    public abstract event MessengerSpecificEventHandler MessengerSpecificEvent;
```
