# Agents

Agent is component, responsible for interaction between some target system and bus. You should use agents in these cases:

- target system API is limited by it's throughput
- target system API has paid access
- you need to balance the load in your own target system
- you need to reduce load to your databases

In general, a typical agent has several methods:
- Subscribe() - subscribes to a request message queue
- SendResponseAsync() - sends response after processing an incoming message
