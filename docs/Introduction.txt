# Botticelli.Bus

Botticelli.Bus is a component, intended for simplifying interaction with wide range of message brokers (such as rabbitmq).
The typical use case is when we need to interact with some public API with limited throughput.
Botticelli.Bus present 2 ways of interaction:

* Agent: the client-side application, that interacts with target API/Database/System/smth else
* Client: the client-side application, that interacts with an agent or another client in order to get some response
