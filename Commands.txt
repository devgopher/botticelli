### Commands

Command is one of basic entities in our framework intended for processing commands and their arguments from chats.

## Command lifecycle

1. Receiving from message
2. Parsing
3. Validation
4. Getting arguments
5. Processing

Every command you define must implement interface ICommand (see https://github.com/devgopher/botticelli/blob/develop/Botticelli.Framework/Commands/ICommand.cs)

## Example

```
public class SampleCommand : ICommand
{
    public Guid Id { get; }
}
```
